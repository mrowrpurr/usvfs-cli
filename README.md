## Building

These instructions are for building `usvfs.exe` on Windows.

> _If you have instructions for building on another platform, let me know and we can share_
> _the instructions here in the README._

1. Download and install the precompiled Boost 1.79.0 binaries for Windows:
   > https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.79.0/boost_1_79_0-msvc-14.3-64.exe/download
   >
   > _Note the directory that you install to!_

2. Download `usvfs` source code from https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/usvfs.git
   > e.g. `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/usvfs.git`

3. Build `usvfs` using Visual Studio (_open the `usvfs\vsbuild\usvfs.sln` solution_)
   > In Visual Studio, select `Release` and `x64` and build the solution.
   >
   > It will fail due to missing `boost` headers and libraries, but that's okay.
   >
   > Go to the "Property Manager" and, for each project which failed to build, right-click and select "Properties".
   >
   > In the "VC++ Directories" section, add the path to the `boost` headers and libraries.

4. Set the `USVFS_ROOT` environment variable to the directory where you cloned `usvfs`
   > e.g. `C:\path\to\usvfs`

5. Build using `xmake`
